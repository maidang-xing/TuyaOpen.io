This Update, We Really Went All Out!\\n\\n\\nAfter months of careful refinement by the team, v1.5.0 is finally here! This update can be said to be our most comprehensive upgrade recently, from the underlying architecture to user experience, every detail has been infused with the team\'s dedication. We also thank the active community and developers who gave us many great suggestions to make the TuyaOpen project more fun and richer. The team is also particularly happy to see community developer [HangYongmao](https://github.com/HangYongmao) join the open-source co-creation and create some fun game demos.\\n\\n### \u{1F4AA} T5AI Platform: Performance Leap, Hardware Ecosystem Explosion\\n\\n**Main Updates This Time:**\\n- **Multi-core Performance Upgrade**: Tuya T5 chips now fully support SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing) architecture, fully unleashing multi-core computing power, significantly improving system concurrency and performance, suitable for high-load and multi-task scenarios.\\n- **MCP (Multimodal Control Platform) Service Officially Launched**: After TuyaOpen devices connect to Tuya Cloud, developers can now publish and connect custom MCP services in the cloud, supporting official presets and custom extensions, greatly enriching the interaction capabilities between intelligent agents and IoT devices.\\n- **Hardware Ecosystem Continues to Expand**: Added support for multiple official and ecosystem development boards, including `TUYA_T5AI_Pocket`, `TUYA_T5A_Core`, `WAVESHARE_T5AI_TOUCH_AMOLED_1_75`, etc., covering more application scenarios and helping developers flexibly choose.\\n- **Innovative Application Examples**: Released a brand new tuya_t5_pocket game console application, showcasing the powerful capabilities of the T5AI platform in multimodal interaction, graphics display, and entertainment applications, further expanding the creative space for embedded development.\\n- **Peripheral & Driver Expansion Upgrade**: This version adds and optimizes support for various peripherals and drivers, including T5AI DVP multiple video sensor drivers, ws2812 and other RGB LED drivers, IR infrared remote control transceivers, etc., greatly enriching hardware expansion capabilities. Developers can easily integrate more sensors, displays, lighting, infrared, and other peripherals to meet diverse smart hardware innovation needs.\\n- **Driver Ecosystem Continues to Grow**: Official and community continue to contribute new drivers, supporting more mainstream and innovative hardware. Whether it\'s audio/video capture, display control, or smart home, entertainment interaction, you can find rich drivers and application examples to help developers quickly realize product creativity.\\n\\n--- \\n\\n# Tuya Platform Integrates MCP!\\nTuya Intelligent Agent Development Platform now fully supports MCP Server integration capabilities. By integrating official MCP Servers or custom-developed MCP Servers, the interaction capabilities between intelligent agents and third-party services and IoT devices can be significantly expanded. This is equivalent to equipping large language models with \\"eyes, arms, and legs\\" to perceive and execute in the physical world, making them no longer limited to text conversations, but achieving intelligent decision-making through LLM, establishing efficient and secure interactions with real-world devices and services, truly building an intelligent bridge between AI and physical systems.\\nTuya\'s MCP Technology Advantages\\n- Designed for IoT Device Ecosystem: Tuya ecosystem devices are plug-and-play, just add MCP Server to the intelligent agent, and devices can be used immediately, seamlessly integrated into various IoT scenarios.\\n- Support Diverse MCP Service Integration: In addition to official preset MCP Servers, it also supports developer custom extensions of MCP services, combining rich service ecosystem with personalized integration.\\n- Simpler Development Integration: Just register the service once on the platform and integrate a lightweight SDK to quickly achieve multi-region access and deployment of MCP Servers.\\n- Global Service Deployment Support: Covers service connections in five major regions worldwide, supports low-latency access nearby, meeting business deployment and compliance needs in different regions.\\n- Secure and Reliable Long Connection Communication: Establishes secure long connections in multiple regions based on WebSocket protocol, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data transmission\\n\\n### \u{1F6E0}\uFE0F MCP SDK Quick Integration Entry\\nDevelopers can quickly integrate MCP capabilities through the official open-source SDK, greatly simplifying the development process.  \\n- **MCP SDK (Open Source) Address**: [https://github.com/tuya/tuya-mcp-sdk](https://github.com/tuya/tuya-mcp-sdk)\\nThis SDK provides complete integration [documentation](https://developer.tuya.com/cn/docs/iot/mcp-manage?id=Ketxzvb2s9ziq), example code, and continuous maintenance, supporting multi-platform and multi-language extensions, helping developers efficiently achieve seamless connection between intelligent agents and the physical world.\\n\\n\\n# TuyaOpen SMP Architecture! What is SMP Architecture? How Does It Improve Performance?\\n![AMP vs SMP](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQIGZ1BIgEvkdELaNGGX_P2SoDTFdHkpTPPiA&s)\\n  \\nAMP (Asymmetric Multi-Processing) and SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing) are two common architectures for multi-core processors:\\n\\n- **AMP (Asymmetric Multi-Processing)**: Each core can run different operating systems or tasks, resource allocation and scheduling between cores are relatively independent, suitable for scenarios with special requirements for real-time or security. For example, one core runs Linux, another core runs RTOS, they don\'t interfere with each other, but development and resource management complexity is higher.\\n\\n- **SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing)**: All cores run the same operating system, the system automatically distributes tasks to each core, cores have equal status and share resources. Developers don\'t need to care about which core specific tasks execute on, development experience is simpler, suitable for high concurrency and multi-task scenarios.\\n\\n**In short**: AMP is more flexible but complex, suitable for special needs; SMP is easier to use, suitable for most general multi-core applications. T5AI v1.5.0 adopts SMP architecture, making multi-core development simpler and more efficient!\\n\\n**What Does TuyaOpen\'s SMP Architecture Mean for Developers? Do You Need to Change Your Development Approach?**\\n> Summary: v1.5.0 makes development more efficient and powerful, but your development habits and code structure basically don\'t need major changes, just focus on new features and multi-core best practices to easily enjoy upgrade benefits!\\n\\n- **Smoother Development Experience**: SMP multi-core support and hardware ecosystem expansion allow you to easily develop high-concurrency, multi-task applications without worrying about performance bottlenecks. Original single-core code doesn\'t need major modifications, the system will automatically schedule multi-core resources, but if you want to further tap multi-core potential, you can achieve higher performance through multi-threading/multi-task programming (such as RTOS tasks, LVGL multi-threaded rendering, etc.).\\n- **API Compatibility Guarantee**: Most APIs are compatible with older versions, existing projects can upgrade smoothly. New hardware and new driver access methods are consistent with before.\\n- **More Creative Space**: LVGL dual versions, rich peripherals and game applications allow you to try more innovative approaches. You can directly reuse official examples, or develop your own applications based on new drivers and new capabilities.\\n- **No Major Refactoring Needed**: If you already have projects based on T5AI, you don\'t need large-scale code refactoring after upgrading to v1.5.0.\\n- **Recommendation**: To fully utilize multi-core and new hardware capabilities, it is recommended to learn and use RTOS tasks, semaphores, queues, and other multi-core concurrent programming methods, refer to official multi-core examples and documentation.\\n\\n> **Have any questions or doubts about SMP architecture?

Clone the TuyaOpen SDK to your local machine, then add the AI chatbot project `your_chat_bot` to the conversation and let the AI Coding tool automatically execute compilation and flashing.\\n\\n- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/tuya/TuyaOpen\\n- Gitee Repository: https://gitee.com/tuya-open/TuyaOpen\\n\\n### Prompt Template\\n\\nYou can refer to the following template to write prompts for the AI Coding tool to guide it in executing compilation and flashing:\\n\\n```\\nHelp me compile and flash this project\\nSet up compilation environment\\nHelp me compile and flash this project, compilation and flashing methods refer to readme documentation and the links below\\nEnvironment setup\\nhttps://tuyaopen.ai/zh/docs/quick-start/enviroment-setup\\nCompilation:\\nhttps://tuyaopen.ai/zh/docs/quick-start/project-compilation\\nFlashing:\\nhttps://tuyaopen.ai/zh/docs/quick-start/firmware-burning\\n```\\n\\n![Prompt Template.png](https://images.tuyacn.com/content-platform/hestia/1756191238cfcb3b4eb39.png)\\n\\n\\n## Authorize Development Board\\n\\nIf the device still cannot be discovered in the **Tuya** App after flashing is complete, the development board needs to be authorized.\\n\\nOpen the `your_chat_bot` project and set the following parameters in the `apps/tuya.ai/your_chat_bot/include/tuya_config.h` file:\\n- `TUYA_OPENSDK_UUID`: UUID can be obtained for free, please scan the QR code below to join the group and contact Tuya staff to receive it.\\n- `TUYA_OPENSDK_AUTHKEY`: Authkey can be obtained for free, please scan the QR code below to join the group and contact Tuya staff to receive it.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Group QR Code\\" src=\\"https://images.tuyacn.com/content-platform/hestia/1756115540e394937a07f.png\\" width=\\"300\\"  />\\n\\n![UUID.png](https://images.tuyacn.com/content-platform/hestia/17561097834516e414c77.png)\\n\\nFor detailed authorization operations, please refer to [Device Authorization](https://tuyaopen.ai/zh/docs/quick-start/equipment-authorization).\\n\\n:::info\\nIf the T5 module you purchased has already been flashed with TuyaOpen authorization code, you do not need to fill in UUID and Authkey.\\n:::\\n\\n## Prepare Images\\n\\nGenerate images corresponding to 7 emotions: \\"happy, angry, sad, shocked, confused, like, thinking\\" on an image generation website, then modify the image pixels to **240 x 240** (because the T5 development board has limited Flash space, larger images take up more Flash space, so image size needs to be reduced).\\n\\nCurrently, Tuya Agent will return up to 21 emotion values based on conversations, as shown in the following table:\\n\\n| Emoji | Expression | Emoji | Expression | Emoji | Expression |\\n|-------|------------|-------|------------|-------|------------|\\n| \u{1F636} | Neutral | \u{1F633} | Embarrassed | \u{1F60C} | Relaxed |\\n| \u{1F642} | Happy | \u{1F62F} | Surprise | \u{1F924} | Delicious |\\n| \u{1F606} | Laughing | \u{1F631} | Shocked | \u{1F618} | Kissy |\\n| \u{1F602} | Funny | \u{1F914} | Thinking | \u{1F60F} | Confident |\\n| \u{1F614} | Sad | \u{1F609} | Winking | \u{1F634} | Sleepy |\\n| \u{1F620} | Angry | \u{1F60E} | Cool | \u{1F61C} | Silly |\\n| \u{1F62D} | Crying | \u{1F644} | Confused | \u{1F60D} | Loving |\\n\\n## Add Images to Project\\n\\nIn embedded development, displaying images on screen is usually quite complex. When writing code manually, you need to crop images to fixed sizes, then convert them to C array format, while also considering screen size, image storage location, and other detailed factors.\\n\\nTherefore, when using AI Coding tools, the more detailed and specific the prompt description, the more accurate and ideal the final effect will be. If there are reference cases, code snippets, or requirement documents, it is recommended to provide them to the tool as reference; if technical details required for development can be clarified in advance, it can further improve the tool\'s output relevance and reduce subsequent adjustment costs.\\n\\nFor example, when asking AI to implement image screen display functionality, you need to explicitly instruct it to first convert images to C array format; otherwise, AI may default to using file path calls, directly trying to open image files in PNG or JPG formats. In addition, image encoding formats are diverse (such as RGB565, RGB888, etc.). If not specified in advance, even if the display effect can be achieved through multiple debugging compilations, it will significantly increase the number of debugging iterations and costs.\\n\\n### Typical Image Encoding Formats\\n\\nThe following table lists common PNG image encoding formats:\\n\\n| Scenario | Typical Encoding Format and Description |\\n|-----------------|----------------------|\\n| Desktop Display PNG | RGB24: Standard true color, ARGB32: Supports transparency |\\n| Embedded UI (such as LVGL) | RGB565/Indexed Color: Uses 16-bit color or indexed color to save resources |\\n| Game/Video Rendering | RGBA8888: High-performance GPUs typically use 32-bit format |\\n\\n### Prompt Template\\n\\nTo make the AI Coding tool understand requirements more accurately, parameters such as image format, size specifications, and image storage location supported by the target device need to be clearly defined. This can effectively reduce compilation debugging times and improve development efficiency. You can refer to the following template for configuration.\\n\\n```\\nGoal: Help me add images from the image folder to the your_chat_bot project. Replace the text emoji displayed for emotion in the current project src/display/ui/ui_chatbot.c, change to display images from the image folder based on emotion values. Use LVGL RGB565 format for images, images need to be converted to C array format.\\nConstraints: If ROM overflows, reduce to 4 main images (Happy, Sad, Angry, Love)\\nTechnology: The screen size used in the current project is H 480, W 320 pixels, using LVGL V8 version GUI library\\nVerification: Compilation succeeds with no ROM overflow, images display normally after flashing\\nAlternative: If 240x240 fails, try 120x120 or further reduce the number of images\\n```\\n\\n![Prompt Template.png](https://images.tuyacn.com/content-platform/hestia/1756114763298dd9e9663.png)\\n\\nAfter accurately identifying your core intent, the AI Coding tool can automatically generate a Python-based image conversion tool in the target project.\\n\\n![Generated Tool.png](https://images.tuyacn.com/content-platform/hestia/1756115044f42f98b5006.png)\\n\\n## Add 2048 Game Interface\\n\\nBefore developing the 2048 game interface, you need to plan the interface design through the AI Coding tool. After providing information such as controller chip performance limitations and screen pixel size to the AI Coding tool, the tool will plan a 4 \xd7 4 board game interface; if actual performance meets standards, a 5 \xd7 5 board layout can be considered later.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Example Image\\" src=\\"https://images.tuyacn.com/content-platform/hestia/17561158982c6d7812f26.png\\" width=\\"500\\"  />\\n\\nThe purpose of this step is to confirm in advance whether the final output effect of the AI Coding tool matches expectations before issuing the function implementation instruction; if there are deviations, additional constraints can be added to the prompt to correct them.\\n\\n### Prompt Template\\n\\nAfter checking the 2048 game interface plan planned by the AI Coding tool, issue an instruction to create a 2048 game interface: need to set a toggle button on the screen to achieve interactive switching between chat interface and game interface; at the same time, the 2048 game interface needs to be saved separately in UI file format for convenient project management.\\n\\n\\n```\\nGoal: Help me add a 2048 game interface to the your_chat_bot project, only need to implement basic 2048 game functionality with score statistics. Can switch back and forth between chat interface and game interface through a button.\\nConstraints: The screen resolution size in the current project is H 480, W 320 pixels, game interface is a 4*4 board.\\nVerification: Compilation succeeds with no ROM overflow, images display normally after flashing\\n\\n```\\n\\n![Prompt.png](https://images.tuyacn.com/content-platform/hestia/1756116811b2d24299207.png)\\n\\n## Effect Experience\\n\\nAt this point, the desktop chatbot developed based on the TuyaOpen open-source conversation project `your_chat_bot` is complete. This robot supports emoji image replacement functionality and integration with the 2048 game interface.\\n\\nHere is the final generated example firmware file: [your_chat_bot_QIO_1.0.1.bin](https://drive.weixin.qq.com/s?k=AGQAugfWAAkS4ye03BAbQAqAb1AFU). You can obtain the firmware and complete flashing to experience the final effect.\\n\\n## Prompt Experience Summary\\n\\n- During project or Demo development, it is recommended to first organize and summarize the overall functional architecture through AI tools, then issue development instructions based on the architecture to improve effectiveness.\\n\\n- The more detailed the upfront prompts, the better the final effect. If there are reference materials, they should be provided to the AI tool as much as possible; if technical details can be clarified in advance, it\'s even better. For example, when implementing image screen display functionality, you need to specify that images need to be converted to C array format and clearly specify the specific encoding format (such as RGB565, RGB888, etc.); if the encoding format is not specified, it will significantly increase debugging times.\\n\\n- Regarding prompts, you can refer to the following template:\\n    \\n    ```\\n    Goal: [What specifically to achieve]\\n    Constraints: [What are the limiting conditions]\\n    Technology: [What tools/methods to use]\\n    Verification: [How to confirm success]\\n    Alternative: [What to do if it fails]\\n    ```\\n    For example:\\n    ```\\n    Goal: Change emotion images from 64x64 to 240x240 pixels\\n    Constraints: If ROM overflows, reduce to 4 main images (Happy, Sad, Angry, Love)\\n    Technology: Use png_to_c_array.py tool to regenerate, update CMakeLists.txt\\n    Verification: Compilation succeeds with no ROM overflow, images display normally after flashing\\n    Alternative: If 240x240 fails, try 120x120 or further reduce the number of images.\\n    ```\\n\\n## Quick Start Project Recommendations\\n\\nCreativity starts with ideas, T5 development board helps you realize them!
